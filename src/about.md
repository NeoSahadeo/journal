Hey, I am a guy with a hundred different hobbies, so writing an "About Me" section is particularly tough. What in the world describes me best? I'm an avid enjoyer of hikes, software, cycling, languages, guitar, music, and watching xQc [düd]. Nothing beats a cycle and trail combo on a Sunday morning.

Programming tools and learning the ins and outs of the software landscape are guilty pleasures of mine. Sitting down and reading through an O'Reilly book and trying to implement that is nerdy fun.

Music drives my life—whether it's a quick trip around the apartment or a six-hour train ride, I'll always have jammers playing.

Current favourite song:

Here's a photo from my hike:
