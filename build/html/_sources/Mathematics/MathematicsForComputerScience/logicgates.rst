Logic Gates
===========

All gates can be derived from the **NAND GATE**.

What is **NAND GATE**?

A **NAND GATE** is a switch that follows the following
truth table.

**NAND GATE**

+---+---+-----+
| A | B | OUT |
+===+===+=====+
| 0 | 0 | 1   |
+---+---+-----+
| 0 | 1 | 1   |
+---+---+-----+
| 1 | 0 | 1   |
+---+---+-----+
| 1 | 1 | 0   |
+---+---+-----+

This is a circuit diagram of the **NAND GATE**.


Next up, is the **NOT GATE**. The gate should invert signals
sent to it. Which gives us a hint of how to design the ciruit.

**NOT GATE**

+---+-----+
| A | OUT |
+===+=====+
| 0 | 1   |
+---+-----+
| 1 | 0   |
+---+-----+
| 0 | 1   |
+---+-----+
| 1 | 0   |
+---+-----+

This is a circuit diagram of the **NOT GATE**.
The inputs into the NAND GATE come from both a single input.
It is then drawn as a triangle with a circle at the tip.
