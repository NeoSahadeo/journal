Limit Laws
==========

Limit laws are a set of rules that tells us how
to handle taking limits.

All limit laws need :math:`f(x)` **and** :math:`g(x)`
to be defined for all values of :math:`x` where :math:`x \ne a`
on **an** open interval.

We then say that:

.. math::
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L(x)

  \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = M(x)

With all the laws, try to think why it makes sense.

Addition
********

The limit of sum of two functions is the sum of the limit of each
function.

.. math::
   \lim_{x \to a}(L+M) = P

.. math::
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) + \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} [f(x) + g(x)]

Subtraction
***********

The limit of the difference of two functions is the difference of
the limit of each function.

.. math::
   \lim_{x \to a}(L-M) = P

.. math::
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) - \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} [f(x) - g(x)]

Multiplication
**************

The limit of the multiplication of two functions is the multiplication
of the limit of each function.

.. math::
   \lim_{x \to a}(L \cdot M) = P

.. math::
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \cdot \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} [f(x) \cdot g(x)]

Division
********

The limit of the division of two functions is the division
of the limit of each function. Where :math:`g(x) \ne 0`

.. math::
   \lim_{x \to a}{({L \over M})} = P

.. math::
  {{\lim_{x \to a} f(x)} \over { \lim_{x \to a} g(x)}} = \lim_{x \to a} [{f(x) \over g(x)}]
